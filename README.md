## Abstract

In the realm of space weather, the prediction of solar phenomena plays a vital role in safeguarding technological assets on Earth. Sunspots, as indicators of solar activity, have implications for radio communication, navigation systems, and power distribution. With an increasing dependence on technology, accurate forecasting of sunspot activity becomes essential. Traditional methods often struggle to capture the intricate patterns in solar data, motivating the exploration of advanced machine learning techniques. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) excel in modeling sequential data, making them well-suited for the temporal nature of sunspot activity. This study focuses on harnessing the capabilities of RNNs to enhance sunspot forecasting accuracy, contributing to the resilience of Earth's technological infrastructure against space weather events.

## Context

In recent years, advancements in space technology and satellite observations have provided an abundance of sunspot data. Sunspots, dark areas on the Sun's surface, are indicative of strong magnetic activity and influence solar radiation. Accurate forecasting of sunspot activity is crucial for anticipating potential impacts on Earth's technology-dependent systems. Traditional forecasting methods often fall short in capturing the dynamic and evolving nature of sunspot patterns. Leveraging machine learning, particularly RNNs, offers a promising avenue to improve the precision and reliability of sunspot predictions. This project explores the application of RNNs to forecast sunspot activity, providing valuable insights for space weather monitoring.

<h2>Dataset</h2>  

Our analysis is based on the [Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations Dataset (Yearly total sunspot number)](https://www.sidc.be/SILSO/datafiles) that provides comprehensive data on sunspot activity. This dataset, collected by the SOHO spacecraft, serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating our machine learning models.
